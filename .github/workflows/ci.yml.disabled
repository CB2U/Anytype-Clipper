# DISABLED: This workflow is temporarily disabled during early development
#
# Reason: The project is in active development (Epic 1.1 completed) and does not
# have test infrastructure configured yet (Jest not set up). The CI workflow was
# failing on every push to main, causing noise and email notifications.
#
# When to re-enable:
# - After test infrastructure is set up (Jest configured)
# - When the project reaches a more stable state
# - Likely during or after Epic focused on testing
#
# How to re-enable:
# 1. Rename this file from 'ci.yml.disabled' back to 'ci.yml'
# 2. Remove this comment block (optional)
# 3. Commit and push to main
# 4. Workflow will become active immediately
